/**
 * WHMCS SDK Sample Provisioning Module Hooks File
 *
 * Hooks allow you to tie into events that occur within the WHMCS application.
 *
 * This allows you to execute your own code in addition to, or sometimes even
 * instead of that which WHMCS executes by default.
 *
 * WHMCS recommends as good practice that all named hook functions are prefixed
 * with the keyword "hook", followed by your module name, followed by the action
 * of the hook function. This helps prevent naming conflicts with other addons
 * and modules.
 *
 * For every hook function you create, you must also register it with WHMCS.
 * There are two ways of registering hooks, both are demonstrated below.
 *
 * @see https://developers.whmcs.com/hooks/
